Rather than learning the building blocks of networking in isolation as one would in a traditional networking course, students learn through working to understand, reproduce, and even extend, existing research work, assembling whatever knowledge and skills are needed along the way. Students work directly with research papers, and associated Internet-derived data sets, in diverse ways following a master-apprentice style model of training in face-to-face tutorial and laboratory sessions. Tutorial content combines mathematical and practical tool-kit building. Assessment covers both individual and team work and takes the form of reports, an oral exam, write-ups of experimental findings in the laboratory, including code, and an exam style online Quiz.\nThis is a challenging course that makes extensive use of Matlab for data analysis, as well as CLI tools in Unix. Students should either have a strong grasp of Matlab, or have a strong programming background, enabling them to pick it up quickly.

Industrial wastewaters have often very different characteristics from domestic and municipal wastewaters which make it very difficult to successfully treat in a sustainable way. The main objective of this subject is to provide the opportunity for students to understand the principles of industrial wastewater treatment, disposal and reuse in order to minimise pollution in a sustainable manner. To get an in-depth understanding of the treatment and disposal of industrial wastewater, this subject commences with classification, characterisation and quantification of industrial wastes. The subject focuses on the principles and mechanisms of pollutant removal, the processes and design of conventional (primary, secondary and tertiary) and advanced (post-treatment) technologies applied in the treatment of industrial effluent.\nVarious environmental management concepts relating to industrial pollution prevention/pollution reduction at source, Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD), and cleaner production are covered. Special emphasis is given to water conservation and recycling since these allow more flexibility and have economic value as a water supply. The subject includes various management practices of industrial waste, i.e. environmental auditing, trade waste policy, environmental rules and legislation, license agreements, etc., to mitigate industrial pollution.

These goals can also be prerequisites to other larger corporate goals which may also have complex and integral interdependencies together with strict time frames and costs. For engineers to be successful in delivering their parts of projects, an appropriate solution is required (ie agreed quality) as well as delivery (ie on time) to an agreed price (ie to budget).\nThis subject helps students to achieve this.

For this reason, more sophisticated control techniques (compared to classical methods learned in previous subjects) need to be designed and implemented to govern more complex systems.\nThis studio subject focuses on aspects of advanced control engineering design for multivariable systems. The overall aim of this studio is to provide a rich and attractive practice-based learning environment for electrical engineering students to deeply learn and become professionally competent in advanced control engineering. Students will work from concept stage to realisation of product, thus, striking a balance between theory and practice. To realise these aims, this studio focuses on the methods of reflective design practice, teamwork, mentoring, and deep learning techniques, including immersion in difficult problems. The subject allows students to move towards senior roles in teams, expects students to become accomplished in reflection, and demonstrate application of modern and advanced control engineering skills, with an accent on design, simulation and practical validation.\n", "topics": ["Modelling and simulation of multivariable systems", "Linearisation of multivariable nonlinear systems", "System model identification of multivariable systems", "State-variable feedback controller and observers", "Multivariable nonlinear stability analysis in the Lyapunov sense", "Optimal control and filtering of multivariable systems", "Robust control of multivariable systems", "Nonlinear control"], "SLOs": ["Mathematically model, simulate and analyse multivariable (not necessarily linear) systems for control purposes", "Propose, design and validate advanced control strategies to create a multivariable autonomous control system conforming to given specifications", "Identify model uncertainties and/or disturbances that can affect the control system performance in order to enhance robustness", "Translate theoretical advanced control designs into control algorithms to achieve a practical implementation of the developed autonomous multivariable control system"], "CILOs": ["Design Oriented: FEIT graduates apply problem solving, design and decision-making methodologies to develop components, systems and processes to meet specified requirements.

The purpose of this modelling concept is to set up an orderly development that is conducive to mathematical analysis.

This relies on discriminating between what are defined as internal and external forces. The mechanically isolated body is referred to as a free body diagram.

The main objectives of this subject are to help students acquire a fundamental knowledge of the finite elements technology, understand how different types of elements are produced, and develop an awareness of the context where these elements are used.\nThis subject is intended primarily for engineering students who wish to develop skills in finite element methodology. The course introduces fundamental concepts as well as practical implementations, of the finite element method.\nThis subject provides the theoretical basis for computer simulation and analysis of a vast spectrum of engineering problems. The method is used primarily in the field of structural mechanics to solve stress problems. This subject is intended as a first subject in finite elements and extends understanding of the method and its application to problems in solid/structural mechanics. Topics include: matrix analysis methods; the derivation of element stiffness matrices of bar and beam elements as well as stiffness matrices of triangular and quadrilateral elements for plane elasticity, shell and solid elements; work equivalent forces; the concept of natural coordinates and isoparametric element formulation; numerical integration and gauss points; finite element modelling techniques; and limitations, errors and solution accuracy of the Finite Element Method (FEM). This subject is also oriented toward users of the FEM and includes a hands-on laboratory component that requires the use of finite element programs in assignments.\n", "topics": ["Lecture 1 - An overview of the finite element method where the concepts of degree-of-freedom, discretization and error are introduced. For illustrative purposes stiffness coefficients of beams are obtained using the force method and incorporated for the analysis using the slope deflection method. This method is revised here because of the similarity of some aspects to finite element analysis. The intention is to introduce some concepts from the physical intuitive point of view. Matrix algebra is also revised.", "Lecture 2 - The essential mathematical tool of Variational Calculus is introduced. Ritz method as a direct variational method forms the foundation of the finite element derivations. Some parts can be abstract for an engineer; however, these ideas later will be fixed with examples and applications.", "Lecture 3 - Finite element method is introduced as a special form of the Ritz method. Nodal interpolation is introduced and continuity requirements are shown to be satisfied using interpolation. Elements that provide exact nodal solutions are shown for bar and beam problems.", "Lecture 4 - Beam finite element formulations are derived. Alternative beam theories are discussed from the elasticity point of view and their limitations are illustrated. We show that a-priori imposed kinematic assumptions of the beam theories significantly simplify the problem; however some conditions of elasticity are violated which can be problematic in connections, elements with holes, machine parts etc. due to local stress distribution.", "Lecture 5 - Elasticity solutions to some specific problems are introduced. The elasticity solution is presented directly without emphasis on the method of solution. It is shown that 2D elasticity problems can be conveniently solved numerically using membrane finite elements. Accuracies of some triangular and rectangular elements are illustrated through examples.", "Lecture 6 - 3D elasticity equations are introduced. Plate kinematic assumptions and the Kirchhoff and Mindlin plate theories (analogous to Euler Bernoulli and Timoshenko beams) are introduced.

A major concern of businesses is the search for competitive advantage and how to best leverage IT resources and align them with business goals to achieve competitive advantage. For IT managers, this raises a number of complex issues to understand and manage. These issues relate to the roles of IT and IT strategy in enabling business processes and generating business benefits. In this subject, theories and methods related to the value of IT are presented and explored. Students learn and discuss business and strategy processes that lead to learning organisations that can achieve sustainable competitive advantage.\nBusiness processes and IT strategy are key concerns for business and IT managers. Managing information is a critical skill for success in today's business environment. Managers need to know about their organisation's capabilities and uses of information resources. This subject aims to provide a foundation to help general business managers become knowledgeable participants in decision-making processes related to information systems (IS). Critically reviewing the contributions of IS resources in businesses and organisational settings establishes a contextual understanding of how IS permeates many aspects of business.\nThrough case studies this subject reinforces material provided in lectures and tutorials, additional research, and prior knowledge while giving groups of students scope to enhance their problem-solving, critical thinking and organisational skills as well as peer learning.

It is not as simple as just having an idea or jumping straight into coding or creating visual assets without a plan. A high-quality game design must be well structured and documented, carefully crafted for a specific target audience, communicated and negotiated with a team of other designers, scoped to be implementable by a given team of developers within time constraints, and evaluated and iterated on many times until a finely tuned game experience emerges.\nA professional game designer is an engineer of entertainment. Thus, in this subject, students will be taught the theoretical concepts and practical methodologies needed to ideate, communicate, implement, and improve upon your designs. In this way, students will learn to combine their existing software and game development skills with creativity and iterative design thinking to craft compelling interactions between players and the system of rules that govern them.\nStudents will start by applying these theories and process to the creation of a physical board game prototype before moving on to creating a digital game in a popular game engine. This subject does not teach game development (e.g. coding or art asset creation) but instead requires students to self-learn what is needed to implement their group's shared vision. Students will adopt a kit-bashing approach to rapidly prototype and iterate on their game designs and playtest them with other students on a weekly basis to collect and analyse feedback. By the end of the session, students will have both a board game and digital game that are novel and refined, which can be used in future employment portfolios to highlight interaction design skills in entertainment domains.\n", "topics": ["Major topics covered in this subject are:"], "SLOs": ["Critique games in terms of their function as dynamic systems of formal and dramatic elements in order to create interactive entertaining experiences for users.", "Create computer games in a team by applying an iterative player-centric design approach.", "Evaluate games by applying playtesting techniques."], "CILOs": ["Socially Responsible: FEIT graduates identify, engage, interpret and analyse stakeholder needs and cultural perspectives, establish priorities and goals, and identify constraints, uncertainties and risks (social, ethical, cultural, legislative, environmental, economics etc.) to define the system requirements.

UX is defined as a person's perceptions and responses that result from the use of a digital product, system or service. Understanding how to approach UX in design is a major focus in interaction design because the quality of UX can affect people's adoption of a particular designed technology. For many technology design companies, paying attention to how people experience their products is the edge that can potentially set them apart from their competition. However, designing UX effectively is difficult because the term UX is very problematic, meaning very different things to different people, in academic research and in industry.\nFirstly, students are provided with some conceptual tools to help them talk about UX productively: to identify, describe, analyse and critique real-life experiences with various types of digital technologies. To put these skills into practice, students are introduced to a range of current and emergent human-computer interactions such as mobile and social computing, pervasive and ubiquitous computing, quantified self, and the 'internet of things' (IoT). Through discussing and exploring particular characteristics, interaction styles, affordances, and the ways these technologies are used in our everyday lives, students develop the skills to be able to understand the types of user experiences that arise from people's interactions with particular technologies, while pursuing specific goals, whether alone or with others, carried out in particular contexts. Through this, they understand how to consider relevant and appropriate user experiences to support when designing for different kinds of human-computer interactions.\nStudents also learn methods, concepts, and techniques used in design activities to support for a specific user experience. This includes user research techniques, sketching, storyboarding, prototyping and evaluation approaches that can support them to design appropriate and engaging user experiences. They hone their skills through responding to a real-world problem, designing a technology solution that not only meets the users' needs effectively but, more importantly, supports desirable and potentially engaging experiences. By building upon students' prior understandings of fundamental interaction design concepts and processes, it is expected that when they successfully complete this subject, they are able to not only design useful and usable technologies, but also technologies that are optimised to support the users' experience.\n", "topics": [], "SLOs": ["Use appropriate conceptual tools to accurately describe, critique, analyse and evaluate user experiences that arise through-and-during interactions with information technology", "Identify the types of user experiences that are most appropriate for different types of human-computer interactions", "Apply appropriate methods, concepts, and techniques to successfully design interactive technologies that can support engaging user experiences during use", "Describe the range of social/technical and experiential concepts that are important to consider when designing technologies that can be experienced positively by users", "Identify and exploit theoretical concepts that can be used to inspire designs that are more engaging for people to use"], "CILOs": ["Socially Responsible: FEIT graduates identify, engage, interpret and analyse stakeholder needs and cultural perspectives, establish priorities and goals, and identify constraints, uncertainties and risks (social, ethical, cultural, legislative, environmental, economics etc.) to define the system requirements.

Thus, in this subject, students will be taught the theoretical concepts and practical methodologies needed to ideate, communicate, implement, and improve upon your designs. In this way, students will learn to combine their existing software and game development skills with creativity and iterative design thinking to craft compelling interactions between players and the system of rules that govern them.\nStudents will start by applying these theories and process to the creation of a physical board game prototype before moving on to creating a digital game in a popular game engine. This subject does not teach game development (e.g. coding or art asset creation) but instead requires students to self-learn what is needed to implement their group's shared vision. Students will adopt a kit-bashing approach to rapidly prototype and iterate on their game designs and playtest them with other students on a weekly basis to collect and analyse feedback.

This is how human-centred design makes people central to the design process. There are many human-centred design methods and several of them are touched on in other interaction design subjects. In this subject we give an overview of the breadth of these methods and focus on two different methods: interviewing and cultural probes.\nInterviewing is one of the most popular methods in human-centred design. The many reasons include the fact that interviewing provides direct information from interviewees, is relatively easy to do (though difficult to do well) and is inexpensive. The interviewing method is flexible in its use, exists in a large number of variations and can be used at any stage of the design process.\nCultural probes, by contrast, is a design method that requires sets of props (probes) which are specifically created or collected to be issued to participants to elicit their response. This method is open and creative, and needs more preparation, but has the potential to generate inspirational responses that can inform design.\nIn this subject students implement both the interviewing method and the cultural probe method, step-by-step through guidance. Students are given a brief to guide their interviewing and cultural probe implementation. Examples are shared of different types of interview and probe methods, and the student can choose to implement the ones that fit their goal best. Students have to recruit their own study participants, at least three to interview and one for the probe study.\n", "topics": ["Throughout the session students will become familiar with the following topics:", "Interviewing", "Cultural probes", "Ethics in user research", "Recruiting and engaging with participants", "Analysis of qualitative research data", "Reporting and communication of research findings, both in written and visual material"], "SLOs": ["Demonstrate knowledge of human-centred design methods.", "Demonstrate an ability to plan, design and carry out small user research projects.", "Develop an analysis of the findings from user research suitable for use in professional projects.", "Explain results and outcomes to others in their cohort and to broader audiences through paper writing, poster and video presentations.", "Practice ethical and responsible conduct in user research.", "Active participation and professional behavior."], "CILOs": ["Socially Responsible: FEIT graduates identify, engage, and influence stakeholders, and apply expert judgment establishing and managing constraints, conflicts and uncertainties within a hazards and risk framework to define system requirements and interactivity.

UX is defined as a person's perceptions and responses that result from the use of a digital product, system or service. Understanding how to approach UX in design is a major focus in interaction design because the quality of UX can affect people's adoption of a particular designed technology. For many technology design companies, paying attention to how people experience their products is the edge that can potentially set them apart from their competition. However, designing UX effectively is difficult because the term UX is very problematic, meaning very different things to different people, in academic research and in industry. \nFirstly, students are provided with some conceptual tools to help them talk about UX productively: to identify, describe, analyse and critique real-life experiences with various types of digital technologies. To put these skills into practice, students are introduced to a range of current and emergent human-computer interactions such as mobile and social computing, pervasive and ubiquitous computing, quantified self, and the 'internet of things' (IoT). Through discussing and exploring particular characteristics, interaction styles, affordances, and the ways these technologies are used in our everyday lives, students develop the skills to be able to understand the types of user experiences that arise from people's interactions with particular technologies, while pursuing specific goals, whether alone or with others, carried out in particular contexts. Through this, they understand how to consider relevant and appropriate user experiences to support when designing for different kinds of human-computer interactions.\nStudents also learn methods, concepts, and techniques used in design activities to support for a specific user experience. This includes user research techniques, sketching, storyboarding, prototyping and evaluation approaches that can support them to design appropriate and engaging user experiences. They hone their skills through responding to a real-world problem, designing a technology solution that not only meets the users' needs effectively but, more importantly, supports desirable and potentially engaging experiences. By building upon students' prior understandings of fundamental interaction design concepts and processes, it is expected that when they successfully complete this subject, they are able to not only design useful and usable technologies, but also technologies that are optimised to support the users' experience.\n", "topics": [], "SLOs": ["Use appropriate conceptual tools to accurately describe, critique, analyse and evaluate user experiences that arise through, and during, interactions with information technology", "Identify the types of user experiences that are most appropriate for different types of human-computer interactions", "Apply appropriate methods, concepts, and techniques to successfully design interactive technologies that can support engaging user experiences during use", "Describe the range of social/technical and experiential concepts that are important to consider when designing technologies that can be experienced positively by users", "Identify and exploit theoretical concepts that can be used to inspire designs that are more engaging for people to use"], "CILOs": ["Socially Responsible: FEIT graduates identify, engage, and influence stakeholders, and apply expert judgment establishing and managing constraints, conflicts and uncertainties within a hazards and risk framework to define system requirements and interactivity.

This is how human-centred design makes people central to the design process. There are many human-centred design methods and several of them are touched on in other interaction design subjects. In this subject we give an overview of the breadth of these methods and focus on two different methods: interviewing and cultural probes.\nInterviewing is one of the most popular methods in human-centred design. The many reasons include the fact that interviewing provides direct information from interviewees, is relatively easy to do (though difficult to do well) and is inexpensive. The interviewing method is flexible in its use, exists in a large number of variations and can be used at any stage of the design process.\nCultural probes, by contrast, is a design method that requires sets of props (probes) which are specifically created or collected to be issued to participants to elicit their response. This method is open and creative, and needs more preparation, but has the potential to generate inspirational responses that can inform design.\nIn this subject students implement both the interviewing method and the cultural probe method, step-by-step through guidance. Students are given a brief to guide their interviewing and cultural probe implementation. Examples are shared of different types of interview and probe methods, and the student can choose to implement the ones that fit their goal best. Students have to recruit their own study participants, at least three to interview and one for the probe study.\n", "topics": ["Throughout the session students will become familiar with the following topics:", "Interviewing", "Cultural probes", "Ethics in user research", "Recruiting and engaging with participants", "Analysis of qualitative research data", "Reporting and communication of research findings, both in written and visual material"], "SLOs": ["Demonstrate knowledge of human-centred design methods.", "Demonstrate an ability to plan, design and carry out small user research projects.", "Develop an analysis of the findings from user research suitable for use in professional projects.", "Explain results and outcomes to others in their cohort and to broader audiences through paper writing, poster and video presentations.", "Practice ethical and responsible conduct in user research.", "Active participation and professional behavior."], "CILOs": ["Socially Responsible: FEIT graduates identify, engage, interpret and analyse stakeholder needs and cultural perspectives, establish priorities and goals, and identify constraints, uncertainties and risks (social, ethical, cultural, legislative, environmental, economics etc.) to define the system requirements.

The subject also introduces students to the practical processes of experience design by allowing students to work on a real-world design project with real users, in a context of peer support and feedback. Students can explore approaches that engage users as participants in the design process, with a view to understanding relationships between users and designers in Experience-Centred Design.
